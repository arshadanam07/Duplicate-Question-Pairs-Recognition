# Duplicate-Question-Pairs-Recognition
Using NLP preprocessing and fuzzy logic, this project generated effective features for duplicate question identification. Through EDA, significant patterns were unveiled, leading to a highly accurate model (97%). Deployed on Heroku with a dedicated website, it revolutionized content management and user experience on platforms like Quora.

This project focused on employing a diverse range of NLP preprocessing techniques and leveraging fuzzy logic to address the challenge of identifying duplicate questions. By generating effective features through these methods, the project aimed to improve content management and user experience on platforms such as Quora and blogging websites.

To begin, the project extensively explored the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA). This analysis revealed significant patterns within question pairs, which served as the foundation for successful feature engineering. By understanding the underlying structures and characteristics of duplicate questions, the project was able to develop robust and informative features.

Utilizing various Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods, the project trained a model to accurately identify duplicate questions. The model achieved an exceptional accuracy rate of 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in discerning duplicate content. This high level of accuracy was a result of the careful selection and engineering of relevant features, as well as the utilization of advanced learning algorithms.

Furthermore, the project focused on the deployment of the trained model on Heroku, a cloud platform. This deployment allowed for easy accessibility and usage of the model through a dedicated website. The development of this website revolutionized the identification of duplicate questions, providing a user-friendly interface for content management. By efficiently detecting duplicate content, the project significantly improved the quality of information and user experience on platforms like Quora and blogging websites.

In summary, this project combined NLP preprocessing techniques, fuzzy logic, exploratory data analysis, and advanced machine learning to tackle the challenge of identifying duplicate questions. Through feature engineering and model training, a highly accurate model was developed, achieving an accuracy rate of 97%. The subsequent deployment of the model on Heroku, along with the development of a dedicated website, revolutionized content management and greatly enhanced the user experience on platforms that rely on question matching and duplicate detection.
